This is a frontend test job for Linnworks. It was perfect opportunity to try out a new framework - Vue. 
It required some more time to get to know the framework, although I'd say the learning curve was extremely small (probably because of experience with Angular and React).

used following dependencies:

"axios": "^0.19.2", - async http client for browser to pull in data
"bootstrap": "^4.4.1" - default styles
"bootstrap-vue": "^2.11.0" - default components based on bootstrap
"core-js": "^3.6.4", 
"lodash": "^4.17.15", 
"node-sass": "^4.13.1",
"sass-loader": "^8.0.2",
"vue": "^2.6.11", - main javascript framework used
"vue-router": "^3.1.6", - routing for vue framework
"vuex": "^3.1.3" - state management library
